# NP-TCMtarget
NP-TCMtarget is a network pharmacology platform for exploring mechanisms of action of TCM at the molecular target level. The core conception of NP-TCMtarget is to untangle the intricate relationship between TCM drugs and targets, identify direct targets that directly bind with TCM components to produce biological effects and indirect targets that mediate the effects of direct targets in the biological molecular network, and finally explore the path of “herbal components-direct targets-indirect targets-biological effects”.

Drug target classification: Direct targets are those that bind to the drug and are responsible for the biological effects of the drug. Indirect targets are those that mediate the biological effects of the drug but not bind to the drug. By interact with its direct targets or sequentially modulate its indirect targets through cellular signal transduction, the drug plays its pharmacological action, such as changing the expression of some genes or changing some phenotypes.
