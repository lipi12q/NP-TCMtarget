# NP-TCMtarget
NP-TCMtarget: a network pharmacology platform for exploring mechanisms of action of Traditional Chinese medicine
---------------------------
NP-TCMtarget is a network pharmacology platform for exploring mechanisms of action of TCM at the molecular target level. The core conception of NP-TCMtarget is to untangle the intricate relationship between TCM drugs and targets, identify direct targets that directly bind with TCM components to produce biological effects and indirect targets that mediate the effects of direct targets in the biological molecular network, and finally explore the path of “herbal components-direct targets-indirect targets-biological effects”.
